# 🧭 EduBlock Roadmap

EduBlock is an on-chain education platform built on the Celo blockchain to issue verifiable educational credentials using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 – MVP Development (Days 1–5)

**Goal:** Build a functional prototype that demonstrates on-chain issuance and verification of SBT-based certificates.

**Tasks:**
1. **Setup environment** using **Celo Composer** and create a smart contract project folder (`/contracts`).
2. **Develop smart contract** in Solidity to issue non-transferable SBTs with metadata (course name, issuer, date, etc.).
3. **Deploy** contract on **Celo testnet (Alfajores)**.
4. **Build simple frontend (React)** to mint and display certificates.
5. **Host code on GitHub** and track progress with commits and issues.

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Validation & Feedback (Week 2–3)

**Goal:** Test MVP with real users and gather feedback from educators and learners.

**Tasks:**
- Onboard 2–3 institutions or mentors to issue test certificates.  
- Collect UX and technical feedback.  
- Document test results in `/docs/feedback.md`.

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 – Integration & Token Logic (Month 2)

**Goal:** Add user authentication and wallet integration.

**Tasks:**
- Integrate **Celo Wallet** and **Valora** for identity management.  
- Implement front-end validation for issued SBTs.  
- Optimize smart contracts for cost efficiency.

---

## 💡 Phase 4 – Expansion & DAO Proposal (Month 3)

**Goal:** Transition EduBlock to a community-driven model.

**Tasks:**
- Design governance proposal for Celo community (Karma milestone).  
- Explore DAO structure for educator participation.  
- Launch v1.0 with verified partners.

---

## 🧩 Phase 5 – Long-term Vision

EduBlock aims to:
- Democratize access to **verifiable, decentralized education**.  
- Enable any educator or institution to **issue blockchain-based credentials**.  
- Foster **digital inclusion and transparency** in education systems across Latin America.
