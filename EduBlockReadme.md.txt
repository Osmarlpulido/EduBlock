# 🧠 EduBlock

**EduBlock** is an on-chain platform built on the **Celo blockchain** that transforms how education is verified and recognized.

In Latin America, millions of learners struggle to prove their knowledge because traditional certificates are centralized, inaccessible, or easily falsified.  
EduBlock solves this by issuing **verifiable, non-transferable credentials (Soulbound Tokens – SBTs)** that certify real learning achievements directly on-chain.

## 🌍 Mission

EduBlock aims to democratize access to verifiable education using blockchain technology.  
Our mission is to empower students, educators, and institutions to **issue, validate, and preserve educational credentials** in a **secure, decentralized, and accessible** way through **SBTs on Celo**.

With EduBlock, knowledge becomes a **personal and intransferable digital asset**, promoting **inclusion, transparency, and trust** in digital education.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Learners** receive Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) as proof of verified educational achievements.  
- **Educators and institutions** can issue credentials transparently via smart contracts.  
- **Employers and communities** can verify skills and certificates instantly on-chain.  
- All credentials are **permanently verifiable**, **non-transferable**, and **accessible from any wallet**.

## 🔗 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Celo  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In Latin America, educational certificates are often **centralized, difficult to access, and easily falsified**, limiting trust in non-formal education.  

EduBlock creates **verifiable on-chain credentials** that return the **ownership of knowledge to the student**, enabling a more equitable and trusted education ecosystem.

## 🚀 Vision

EduBlock envisions a future where **education is a personal, digital, and verifiable asset** accessible to everyone and trusted by everyone.
